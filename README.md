# Moviz

### What is Moviz ? 
Moviz is the attempt to make an ultralight version of IMDB in one month. Even if this app is **far** from production ready, i wanted to give it a try. Stack is the following:

###### Main
- Vue
- Vuetify for material design
- Google Firebase

###### Libraries/Plugins
- i18n
- Video.js

## Features
- [x] User login system (Firebase Auth)
- [x] Write and manage reviews
- [x] Add movies in the app using the admin form
- [ ] Full text search

The app also has a small role system where moderators can restrict reviews, admins can add movies and superadmins can add/remove roles and ban users.

## Issues & performance
This project is for learning purposes; the performance is not good due to unused CSS from Vuetify, component code that is not optimized and also some features are not finished yet.
